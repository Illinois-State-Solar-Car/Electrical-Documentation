This is the working example of how we want to set up our solar car documentation. The are a few ways to go about using github pages moving forward.
- Do we want to focus on this markdown style documentation and just create links between different documents
- Do we want to create a custom site and host it here
- Do we want to use ReadTheDocs with this as our hosting solution
